# AtomStack-M50-AirAssist
Air assist parts for the AtomStack M50 laser module, which is the default laser module for the X7 PRO laser engraver.

The area with the threaded brass lens holder of is not cooled much and I've had a cracked lens.
They send me a new laser unit, while I designed this nozzle that actively cools the  brass.
But then the eyes for the screws did not fit anymore; they did a revision on the M50.
Did not updated the CAD file but just saw the eyes away and fitted it by using a dremel grinder to post process the nozzle and try screwing it on the brass while firmly pushing; succes!

THe air IN is for a 4x2mm PTFE tube through the unit up through the acrylic lid at the top.
There is a little hole in the side of the tube entry to draw air in while resin printing it;
else the resin will be trapped and over exposed == cured.
The little hole will be closed when the tube is in.

The FreeCAD file will load and respond ultra slow.
It is spreadsheet driven and consist of many features.
